JA3 - pre-baked into a lot of security applications like SecurityOnion
JA3 is a method to fingerprint SSL/TLS client connection based on fields in the Client Hello message from the SSL/TLS handshake. 
The following fields within the Client Hello message are used: SSL/TLS Version, Accepted Ciphers, List of Extensions, Elliptic Curves, and Elliptic Curve Formats. 
The result being a MD5 hash serving as the purpose for the fingerprint. Because the SSL/TLS handshake is sent in clear text we can use it to fingerprint any client application using the information within the Client Hello message.
