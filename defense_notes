JA3 - pre-baked into a lot of security applications like SecurityOnion
JA3 is a method to fingerprint SSL/TLS client connection based on fields in the Client Hello message from the SSL/TLS handshake. 
The following fields within the Client Hello message are used: SSL/TLS Version, Accepted Ciphers, List of Extensions, Elliptic Curves, and Elliptic Curve Formats. 
The result being a MD5 hash serving as the purpose for the fingerprint. Because the SSL/TLS handshake is sent in clear text we can use it to fingerprint any client application using the information within the Client Hello message.

a. Purpose of DCO. The purpose of DCO is to halt adversary offensive initiative, sustain
or regain friendly initiative, and, if required, create conditions for a counteroffensive. It is not
solely defined by the specific effect created or the capabilities employed.

under the layers of cyber, given a country : physical layer

dco phase involves - little engagement, includes intel : screen

cpt operations process - step provde net diagram or range info : step 2 terrain identification

defensive prep of env - shape terrain or create situational awareness : adverse terrain

disrupt symbol : Integrates direct and indirect fires, terrain, and
obstacles to upset an enemy’s formation or
tempo, interrupt the enemy’s timetable, or cause
enemy forces to commit prematurely or attack in a
piecemeal fashion.

objective used by commander purpose slow or halt attack : c. Gain Time. Commanders may employ defensive measures to gain time. Such measures
succeed by slowing or halting an attack while allowing friendly forces time to reinforce the
defense.
